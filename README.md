🚀 Space Station Safety Monitoring – Hackground India 2K25
📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of Hackground India 2K25 × Duality AI – Final Space Station Hack.
Our goal is to enhance astronaut safety in space stations by using real-time object detection powered by YOLOv8.

The system identifies and monitors critical safety equipment:

🔧 Toolbox

🧯 Fire Extinguisher

🫧 Oxygen Tank

This ensures astronauts can quickly locate essential tools during emergencies, even in challenging space environments such as low light, occlusions, and microgravity.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Trained on Falcon’s synthetic dataset for space equipment.

✅ High accuracy with YOLOv8 object detection.

✅ Optimized for real-time inference.

✅ Works under space-like conditions (lighting + occlusions).

✅ Bonus Application: Real-time Safety Dashboard with Gemini API integration.
